// Builds the CLX1 index by walking the SD card once.
//
// M1 derives everything from paths and filenames; reading titles and authors out
// of the EPUBs themselves is M2 (LibraryEnrich), which rewrites records in place
// and never re-walks.
//
// Shape of the build, and why:
//
//   * ONE walk. Records go straight into a staging file in discovery order, so
//     nothing proportional to the library stays resident. Only a small sort array
//     does, and it is capped.
//   * Duplicate directory entries are dropped. A damaged FAT can hand the same
//     file out twice — measured on a real card: 6 of 75 entries were duplicate
//     dirents resolving to one inode — and without this the shelf shows phantom
//     books that cannot be opened.
//   * Unreadable entries are skipped, never fatal. The same card had 7 entries
//     whose names enumerate but whose contents cannot be opened.
//   * Install is write-then-rename, so an interrupted build leaves the previous
//     index untouched rather than a half-written one.
